Hey there, I'm Ishan! I am a data professional in the process of wrapping up my Master's in Data Science at Boston University. I have experience in engineering custom-tailored computational analysis solutions and providing in-depth analysis of relevant data, accross a variety of industries. 

I believe data is a powerful tool, and my end goal is to make data more accessible, insightful, and useful to help solve real-world problems, ease bottlenecks, and push discoveries and research. My interests include Machine Learning, User Behavior, Business Intelligence, Data Visualization, Cryptography, and Bioinformatics.

In my free time I enjoy composing music, traveling, cooking, and playing video games (see [misc](https://iranjan31.github.io/misc) for more)!
