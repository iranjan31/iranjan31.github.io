# Music

## A Cappella!

I am currently working on the Operations Committee for the [Association of South-Asian A Cappella](https://desiacappella.org), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that is dedicated to championing the unique fusion musical genre of South Asian A Cappella. My work revolves around scoring and judging processes for the competitive collegiate South-Asian A Cappella circuit, serving 67 teams at various colleges and universities nationwide!

Some projects I've worked on were implementing digital scoring processes for competitions (Google Apps Script + Python), and developing a custom-tailored ELO-based ranking system for competitive teams to determine national championship qualification (you can see the ranking for last year [here](https://desiacappella.org/2024-elo-rankings/)).

## Music Composition and Production

I compose and produce music in the progressive metal/rock space under the artist name 1R.fm. You can check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/1rmusic.fm/), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06I5uFtJcoOQbiictSQAAD?si=WQs9x3uDQ7GA3De_224Ckg), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@1Rmusicfm), and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/1rmusic) links for some songs I've posted and content.

# Travel

I try to vlog my travels when I can, though I'm not very good at it :P. I'm about an year late posting in editing and posting stuff that you can eventually find [here](https://www.youtube.com/@iranjan31).
